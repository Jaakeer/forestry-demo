### How do I create a shipment?

Click on that and you will see a pop-up
You need to fill in all the details such as:
- Dispatch Quantity
- No. of packages
- Net weight
- Driver details
- Transporter Details:
   - E-Way Bill details
   - Truck Type
   - Truck No. / AWB No.
- Upload Invoice:
- Fill in the Invoice number and Invoice date (If you don’t remember the invoice go to next step)
- Click on “Upload Invoice”
- Select the Invoice file and click “Open”(Bizongo has a smart scanning feature which will pick the Invoice number and Invoice date from the file)
- Review the Number and date and click on “Review and Create”
- Review the details of the product and transport details here
- Click on “Create Shipment” (You can click on “edit” to make any changes**)
- Confirm on the pop-up and Click on “Yes, create shipment”
